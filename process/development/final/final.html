        <p>In many cultures and spaces, birds convey various meanings and messages, such as death, life, and change</p>
        <p>In this platform, each bird symbolizes a certain region that multiple <strong>immigrant women</strong> have migrated from and each of their stories of struggle, joy, and gratitude. These stories often go unheard, but through the voices provided by this platform, they hope to reach you and offer you a moment of learning of their past, present, and futures.</p>

          <p>The Hummingbird was born on August 22, 1974 in a <span id="fact12" class="facthov">pueblo</span> called Totatiche, in Jalisco, Mexico. Before she was of school age, the Hummingbird and her family lived in a <span id="fact11" class="facthov">rancho</span>. The land she lived on belonged to her grandfather, her mother’s dad. The hummingbird doesn't remember how long she lived there, but she worked the land with her father, even though she was too young and too small. There were cows, sheeps, goats, pigs, and horses, all of which they cared for. There was no light, no electricity, and they lit up the house with lamps fueled by petroleum. There was no plumbing, but there was a spring they would get water from. They used to this water to drink, to cook, and to clean. They also used it to water the various crops and trees. There were guavas, peaches, apricots, avocados, corn, cucumber, sweet potatoes, garbonzos, regular potatoes, so many things.</p>
          <div id="f12" class="fact">
            <p>A pueblo is a village or town</p>

          <p>When she was of grade school age, the Hummingbird came to live with her grandfather and grandmother. They lived in a different pueblo than where she was from. She started going to school in another pueblo that was close. The Hummingbird's aunts lived near her grandparents and they cared for the church, making sure it was clean and she would sometimes join them. They would leave at 4am and they swept, mopped, scraped gum off surfaces, and maintained the benches. It wasn’t a hard life there.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="three-1" class="space"></div>
        <div id="three1" class="three" data-aos="fade-right">
          <p>One day the Hummingbird's mom took her back to the pueblo where she was born. Shortly after, her dad left for the United States to work, <span id="fact13" class="facthov">but he would rarely send money back home</span>. There she continued going to school and when she was 11, she started babysitting and housekeeping for another family. From there, she went to work at a restaurant. In the mornings she’d go to school and in the evenings she’d work at the restaurant. Then the owner of the place left for the United States, but the husband stayed back with one of his daughters. She started working for him at his home. He paid her <span id="fact14" class="facthov">50,000 pesos a month</span>. After she finished 9th grade, she no longer had money to continue going to school.</p>
          <div id="f13" class="fact">
            <p>Many families depend on individual members of the family to go work abroad and send money back home. The money sent back to these families and/or communities is called a <strong>remittance</strong>.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="f14" class="fact">
            <p>50,000 pesos is equivalent to 2,630.98 U.S. dollars</p>

        <div id="four1" class="four" data-aos="fade-left">
          <p>During that year the Hummingbird was not in school, her dad came from the US to visit. The day before he left, her mom told her that her dad would leave the following day and that she could go with him if she wanted. She fixed her bags and she left. She went with no visa, just <span id="fact16" class="facthov"><em>con la licencia de dios, todopoderoso</em></span>. Her dad did not take her to live with him, and he left her with his brother and his brother’s wife. She stayed with them for 2 weeks and then she left to her mom’s sisters. From there, they found her a babysitting job with a distant family member. She lived there with the family and was paid $50 a week. When she was 16 years old, she became pregnant with her first born. The Hummingbird decided to leave her aunt's home 3 months before she was due, and went to live with her boyfriend and his father.</p>

          <p>When her daughter turned 2, she started working at a citrus fruit packaging plant where she worked 12 hours a day, on her feet in one single place. She was paid a minimum wage of about 4 dollars, but this was only a seasonal job. She was eventually laid off, and she started doing house cleaning again, and while doing that, she found work at a Jack in the Box in 1995. She learned English in work by interacting with customers and her coworkers. She never felt like she was being discriminated against, in and out of work, but she did not have papers and could not have a license. In 1991 her dad submitted an application for her <span id="fact17" class="facthov">green card</span>. The process was long and difficult and costly. She became a resident in September 2009, over a decade after she applied. Her father died in 2011 long before the Hummingbird became a citizen in May 2016.</p>

          <p>The hummingbird had 8 siblings, some of which also came to this country. Some became <span id="fact18" class="facthov">citizens via their husbands, some via their children</span>, some are still struggling to live undocumented, and one died some time after deportation. She is one of the fortunate immigrants that have come to this country and got documentation. She has lived here most of her life, this is her one and only home.</p>

            <p>Family reunification is a legal basis that an immigrant can use to petition to bring an immediate family member (spouse, parent, child) from their home country to the country they are currently in. From this point on, family members can apply for permanent residency, and eventually citizenship.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="two-2" class="space"></div>
        <div id="two2" class="two" data-aos="fade-left"><p>However, despite how hard her family worked to make ends meet, it became increasingly difficult to provide basic needs to everyone, especially after the death of her father. The Eagle-Hawk eventually was forced to drop out of school around 13-14 years of age and began working in order to better support her family.</p></div>
        <div id="three-2" class="space"></div>
        <div id="three2" class="three" data-aos="fade-right">
          <p>The Eagle-Hawk had heard stories from other young women in her community about how others were immigrating to America with <span id="fact1" class="facthov">work visas and found well-paying jobs</span> that weren't available for women in Manado. The things she heard about working abroad enticed the Eagle-Hawk and she thought it would be easier for her and her family if she went abroad for several years in America to find better work. Eventually, she decided to immigrate to America. However, upon coming to America she soon found that the rumors about the streets being paved in gold weren't true, nor was there any prosperity for anyone like her, but still, she was optimistic.</p>
          <div id="f1" class="fact">
            <p>Multiple countries including but not limited to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India benefit from <strong>exporting labor</strong>, meaning that these countries gain income by sending their own citizens abroad to richer countries on work visas to earn money and send back home to their families.</p>

          <p>She ended up sharing a tiny apartment with several other women like her who were working abroad, and eventually found work through a friend, <span id="fact2" class="facthov">first as a maid and later as a home care assistant for the disabled</span>. The work was difficult and long since it required a lot of physical labor, but she made more money than she ever could if she had stayed at home. The hummingbird planned to stay in America for several more years in order to get her family to a more stable place, but this plan all changed when she became pregnant.</p>

            <p>Many migrant women workers often become domestic laborers in other countries. Domestic labor includes work involving child-rearing, housekeeping and more.</p>

          <p>Although the Eagle-Hawk was happy at first, her life took an unfortunate turn. Her boyfriend at the time began using crystal meth and started physically and emotionally abusing her after she had her first child. The abuse continued even after they had a second child. The Eagle-Hawk was scared and unsure of her future, and <span id="fact15" class="facthov">due to the language barrier and lack of protections for immigrants who are survivors of abuse</span>, she felt trapped. She wanted to go back home to her family who promised to take care of her and her children, but she knew that if she went back, her children wouldn't have access to education or safety like in America. America had never been kind to her; this country and its people treated her like she was disposable, took advantage of her labor, and subjected her to all kinds of <span id="fact3" class="facthov">sexism</span>, <span id="fact4" class="facthov">xenophobia</span>, and <span id="fact5" class="facthov">racism</span>. However, the hummingbird knew that although America did not treat her well, perhaps it would be different for her children and after much pain and deliberation, she decided to stay in America and left her abuser.</p>

            <p>Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee may not have access to bilingual shelters, financial assistance, or food.

          <p>She overstayed her work visa and out of fear that she would be deported if she tried to renew it, she became <span id="fact6" class="facthov">undocumented</span>. To this day, the Eagle-Hawk still longs to see her family back in Manado again, but feels trapped in a country that adamantly calls for the <span id="fact7" class="facthov"> deportation</span> of women like her.

          <p>The Swallow was born in the Philippines with a scattered family. Her mother and father were still married but had separated.

          <p>It took six and a half years of raising their child as a single mom before the Swallow's husband was able to <span id="fact8" class="facthov">bring the both of them to the States.</span> While their child was automatically granted citizenship, the Swallow had to go through <span id="fact9" class="facthov">another route to get her citizenship</span>. While she worked on another production line in the States, she also took night classes at the local community college to work on her AA degree in accounting.</p>

            <p>Family reunification is a legal basis that an immigrant can use to petition to bring an immediate family member (spouse, parent, child) from their home country to the country they are currently in.

            <p>Naturalization, which is the pathway to citizenship for immigrants, is a process that requires that the person applying has been a permanent resident for 5 years, files a USCIS Form N-400, gets fingerprinted, undergoes an interview, and attends an official ceremony.

          <p>Despite only having an Associate's degree, the Swallow was able to rise through the corporate ladder in the finance department of the medical company she was working for. Through hard work and perseverance, she was able to become a Senior Accountant, a position that usually requires a BS degree to get. However, when the company filed for bankruptcy and she was forced to find another work location that could provide her with a similar position without having the necessary “education” requirements.</p>

          <p>After several jobs in companies that limited the scope of her abilities, the Swallow landed another position at another medical company that was closer to where she had lived. There, she was able to have an environment in which she could thrive without the judgement of not having the same higher education experience as some of her co-workers with the same position. It didn’t take long until she was promoted to an Accounting Manager, a position that requires a Master’s degree.</p>

        <h2>about under the sky</h2>
        <p>Inspired by artist Jess X Snow's narrative animation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rN0fdwq30I&t=0s">"Migration is Natural,"</a> this project is a creative platform for audiences to learn more about the struggles of immigrant women using motifs of the sky and birds. This project hopes to give immigrant women a voice to share their experiences and to help those outside of their communities to become more educated about issues that these women face.</p>
        <h3>What do the birds mean?</h3>
        <p>This project uses birds to symbolize the journeys of immigrant women. Birds hold different cultural meanings to different communities, but in this project the freedom of these birds to migrate across borders represents the freedom that many migrants desire in order to be able to live better lives without facing xenophobia-induced hate and violence. In this project, the birds are used to represent each woman's story and are specifically chosen based off of the region each person has migrated from.</p>
        <h3>Statistics About Immigrant Women</h3>
        <p>Immigrant women are often subject to various forms of discrimination based off of race, documentation status, class, gender, and much more. The following statistics provide a deeper view of what life in the United States of America is like for these immigrant women.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One in three (32.5 percent) immigrant women work in service occupations, and are less likely than U.S.-born women to work in office and administrative support occupations (13.3 percent of employed immigrant women work in these occupations compared with 21.5 percent of employed U.S.-born women) and in professional and related occupations (21.8 percent compared with 27.0 percent). <a href="https://statusofwomendata.org/immigrant-women/">x</a></li>
          <li>Three in ten immigrant women (29.6 percent) have less than a high school diploma, with women from Mexico and El Salvador are the most likely to have less than a high school diploma (57.3 and 52.7 percent, respectively). <a href="https://statusofwomendata.org/immigrant-women/">x</a></li>
          <li>Immigrant women are more likely than U.S.-born women to live in poverty (19.7 percent compared with 14.7 percent). <a href="https://statusofwomendata.org/immigrant-women/">x</a></li>
          <li>Immigrant women are significantly less likely to have health insurance coverage than U.S.-born women (66.3 percent of immigrant women aged 18–64 compared with 84.6 percent of U.S.-born women of the same age range). <a href="https://statusofwomendata.org/immigrant-women/">x</a></li>
          <li> Immigrant women often suffer higher rates of battering than U.S. citizens because they may
          come from cultures that accept domestic violence or because they have less access to legal
          and social services than U.S. citizens. Additionally, immigrant batterers and victims may
          believe that the penalties and protections of the U.S. legal system do not apply to them. <a href="https://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/Children_and_Families/Immigrant.pdf">x</a></li>
          <li>Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee may not have access to bilingual shelters,
          financial assistance, or food. It is also unlikely that they will have the assistance of a
          certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to the police or a 911 operator, or
          even in acquiring information about their rights and the legal system. <a href="https://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/Children_and_Families/Immigrant.pdf">x</a></li>
