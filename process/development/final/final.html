        <p>In many cultures and spaces, birds convey various meanings and messages, such as death, life, and change</p>
        <p>In this platform, each bird symbolizes a certain region that multiple <strong>immigrant women</strong> have migrated from and each of their stories of struggle, joy, and gratitude. These immigrant women's stories often go unheard, but through the voices provided by this platform, they hope to reach you and offer you a moment of learning of their past, present, and futures.</p>

        <div id="two-2" class="space"></div>
        <div class="two" data-aos="fade-left"><p>However, despite how hard her family worked to make ends meet, it became increasingly difficult to provide basic needs to everyone, especially after the death of her father.</p></div>
        <div id="three-2" class="space"></div>
        <div class="three" data-aos="fade-right">
          <p>The hummingbird had heard stories from other young women in her community about how others were immigrating to America with <span id="fact1" class="facthov">work visas and found well-paying jobs</span> that weren't available for women in Sulawesi. The hummingbird understood that sacrifices were to be made and she decided to immigrate to America in order to find work and help support her family. Upon coming to America, the hummingbird soon found that the streets were not paved in gold, nor was there any prosperity for anyone like her, but still, she was optimistic.</p>
          <div id="f1" class="fact">
            <p>Multiple countries including but not limited to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India benefit from <strong>exporting labor</strong>, meaning that these countries gain income by sending their own citizens abroad to richer countries on work visas to earn money and send back home to their families.</p>

          <p>She found work through a friend, <span id="fact2" class="facthov">first as a maid and later as a home care assistant</span> for the disabled. The work was difficult and long, but she made more money than she ever could if she had stayed at home. The hummingbird planned to stay in America for several more years in order to get her family to a more stable place, but this plan all changed when she became pregnant.</p>
          <div id="f2" class="fact">
            <p>Many migrant women workers often become domestic laborers in other countries. Domestic labor includes work involving child-rearing, housekeeping and more.</p>
            <p>Women working these jobs are often subjected to underpayment and mental, sexual, and physical abuse</p>

          <p>The hummingbird was scared and unsure of her future. She wanted to go back home to her family, but she knew that if she went back, her child wouldn't have access to education or safety like in America. America had never been kind to her; this country and its people treated her like she was disposable, took advantage of her labor, and subjected her to all kinds of <span id="fact3" class="facthov">sexism</span>, <span id="fact4" class="facthov">xenophobia</span>, and <span id="fact5" class="facthov">racism</span>. However, the hummingbird knew that although America did not treat her well, perhaps it would be different for her children. After much pain and deliberation, she decided to stay.</p>
          <div id="f3" class="fact">
            <p>Sexism is the system of discrimination and exclusion that oppresses people based off of their gender identities, including but not limited to trans people, gender non-conforming people, women, and more.</p>

          <p>She overstayed her work visa and out of fear that she would be deported if she tried to renew it, she became <span id="fact6" class="facthov">undocumented</span>. To this day, the hummingbird still longs to see her family back in Sulawesi again, but feels trapped in a country that adamantly calls for the <span id="fact7" class="facthov"> deportation</span> of women like her. Despite the struggles she endured, the hummingbird never regretted putting her children before her, and she is now the proud mother of two soon-to-be college graduates.</p>
          <div id="f6" class="fact">
            <p>Undocumented people are non-citizens living in the United States without a current, lawful immigration status.  Undocumented individuals either entered without inspection, OR entered with a valid visa or other status, and overstayed the authorized duration of that status.</p>

            <p>Deportation refers to the forced removal of undocumented individuals.

            <p>Family reunification is a legal basis that an immigrant can use to petition to bring an immediate family member (spouse, parent, child) from their home country to the country they are currently in.

        <h2>about under the sky</h2>
        <p>Inspired by artist Jess X Snow's narrative animation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rN0fdwq30I&t=0s">"Migration is Natural,"</a> this project is a creative platform for audiences to learn more about the struggles of immigrant women using motifs of the sky and birds. This project hopes to give immigrant women a voice to share their experiences and to help those outside of their communities to become more educated about issues that these women face.</p>
        <h3>What do the birds mean?</h3>
        <p>This project uses birds to symbolize the journeys of immigrant women. Birds hold different cultural meanings to different communities, but in this project the freedom of these birds to migrate across borders represents the freedom that many migrants desire in order to be able to live better lives without facing xenophobia-induced hate and violence. In this project, the birds are used to represent each woman's story and are specifically chosen based off of the region each person has migrated from.</p>
        <h3>Statistics About Immigrant Women</h3>
        <p>Immigrant women are often subject to various forms of discrimination based off of race, documentation status, class, gender, and much more.</p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about how to better support immigrant women, visit the <a href="https://www.icwclaw.org/">Immigration Center for Women and Children</a> to learn more.</p>
