Although the hummingbird's family was poor, they still had plenty of joy and happiness to share with each other. </div>
        <div id="two-1" class="two" data-aos="fade-left">However, despite how hard her family worked to make ends meet, it became increasingly difficult to provide basic needs to everyone, especially after the death of her father. </div>
        <div id="three-1" class="three" data-aos="fade-right">The hummingbird had heard stories from other young women in her community about how others were immigrating to America with work visas and found well-paying jobs that weren't available for women in Sulawesi. The hummingbird understood that sacrifices were to be made and she decided to immigrate to America in order to find work and help support her family. Upon coming to America, the hummingbird soon found that the streets were not paved in gold, nor was there any prosperity for anyone like her, but still, she was optimistic.</div>
        <div id="four-1" class="four" data-aos="fade-left">She found work through a friend, first as a maid and later as a home care assistant for the disabled. The work was difficult and long, but she made more money than she ever could if she had stayed at home. The hummingbird planned to stay in America for several more years in order to get her family to a more stable place, but this plan all changed when she became pregnant.</div>
        <div id="five-1" class="five" data-aos="fade-right">The hummingbird was scared and unsure of her future. She wanted to go back home to her family, but she knew that if she went back, her child wouldn't have access to education or safety like in America. America had never been kind to her; this country and its people treated her like she was disposable, took advantage of her labor, and subjected her to all kinds of sexism, xenophobia, and racism. However, the hummingbird knew that although America did not treat her well, perhaps it would be different for her children. After much pain and deliberation, she decided to stay. </div>
        <div id="six-1" class="six" data-aos="fade-left">She overstayed her work visa and out of fear that she would be deported if she tried to renew it, she became <strong>undocumented</strong>. To this day, the hummingbird still longs to see her family back in Sulawesi again, but feels trapped in a country that adamantly calls for the deportation of women like her. Despite the struggles she endured, the hummingbird never regretted putting her children before her, and she is now the proud mother of two soon-to-be college graduates.</div>

          <h2>the swallow</h2>
          <p class="cw">content warnings: none</p>
          <p class="cw">Philippines to U.S.A.</p>
          <div class="down">
            <p class="cw">scroll down</p>
            <img src="images/arrow.gif" alt="down arrow" width="40">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="one-3" class="one" data-aos="fade-right">The Swallow was born in the Philippines with a scattered family. Her mother and father were still married but had separated. Despite being the middle child, she did not experience much of what that meant - all her siblings lived apart from her as they were all living with different family relatives.</div>
        <div id="two-3" class="two" data-aos="fade-left">She then met her future husband while working at a Panasonic factory. After a couple of years, they got married and had a child. She gave birth without him as he was working abroad at the time. Her parents were non-existent in her life growing up until her mom found out that she had a child and she had asked her ‘help’ in exchange for money which her mother then exploited.</div>
        <div id="three-3" class="three" data-aos="fade-right">It took six and a half years of raising their child as a single-mom before the Swallow's husband was able to bring the both of them to the States. While their child was automatically granted citizenship, the Swallow had to go through another route to get her citizenship. While she worked on another production line in the States, she also took night classes at the local community college to work on her AA degree in accounting.</div>
        <div id="four-3" class="four" data-aos="fade-left">Despite only having an AA degree, the Swallow was able to rise through the corporate ladder in the finance department of the medical company she was working for. Through hard work and perseverance, she was able to become a Senior Accountant, a position that usually requires a BS degree to get. However, when the company filed for bankruptcy and she was forced to find another work location that could provide her with a similar position without having the necessary “education” requirements.</div>
        <div id="five-3" class="five" data-aos="fade-right">After several jobs in companies that limited the scope of her abilities, the Swallow landed another position at another medical company that was closer to where she had lived. There, she was able to have an environment in which she could thrive without the judgement of not having the same higher education experience as some of her co-workers with the same position. It didn’t take long until she was promoted to an Accounting Manager, a position that requires a Master’s degree.</div>
        <div id="six-3" class="six" data-aos="fade-left">She was humble the entire time, refusing promotions and bonuses because she felt that she did not deserve them due to her limited English skills and lack of a degree. She knows that she could not credit all of her successes to hard work alone. Without the right connections and luck that is needed to move up in the States, she knew that she could not credit all of her success to hard work alone when so many other immigrants were working just as hard yet not bearing the same outcome.</div>
