          <h2>the hummingbird</h2>
          <p class="cw">content warnings: deportation</p>
          <p class="cw">Honduras to U.S.A.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="one" class="storyone" data-aos="fade-right">The hummingbird's story starts in the island of Sulawesi. This was the place the hummingbird called home and where she grew up. Although the hummingbird's family was poor, they still had plenty of joy and happiness to share with each other. </div>
        <div id="two" class="storyone" data-aos="fade-right">However, despite how hard her family worked to make ends meet, it became increasingly difficult to provide basic needs to everyone, especially after the death of her father. </div>
        <div id="three" class="storyone" data-aos="fade-right">The hummingbird had heard stories from other young women in her community about how others were immigrating to America with work visas and found well-paying jobs that weren't available for women in Sulawesi. The hummingbird understood that sacrifices were to be made and she decided to immigrate to America in order to find work and help support her family. Upon coming to America, the hummingbird soon found that the streets were not paved in gold, nor was there any prosperity for anyone like her, but still, she was optimistic.</div>
        <div id="four" class="storyone" data-aos="fade-right">She found work through a friend, first as a maid and later as a home care assistant for the disabled. The work was difficult and long, but she made more money than she ever could if she had stayed at home. The hummingbird planned to stay in America for several more years in order to get her family to a more stable place, but this plan all changed when she became pregnant.</div>
        <div id="five" class="storyone" data-aos="fade-right">The hummingbird was scared and unsure of her future. She wanted to go back home to her family, but she knew that if she went back, her child wouldn't have access to education or safety like in America. America had never been kind to her; this country and its people treated her like she was disposable, took advantage of her labor, and subjected her to all kinds of sexism, xenophobia, and racism. However, the hummingbird knew that although America did not treat her well, perhaps it would be different for her children. After much pain and deliberation, she decided to stay. </div>
        <div id="six" class="storyone" data-aos="fade-right">She overstayed her work visa and out of fear that she would be deported if she tried to renew it, she became <strong>undocumented</strong>. To this day, the hummingbird still longs to see her family back in Sulawesi again, but feels trapped in a country that adamantly calls for the deportation of women like her. Despite the struggles she endured, the hummingbird never regretted putting her children before her, and she is now the proud mother of two soon-to-be college graduates.</div>
