      <h2>Background Research</h2>
      <p>For this project, I wanted to look into how migration policy and xenophobia affects migrant women workers and how their identities as women inform their experiences in the United States. In the United States, there are about 21 million female immigrants, making up about 13 percent of the female population. [1] The most prominent sub-groups within this demographic include women from Mexico, the Philippines, China, and India. [1] In terms of labor trends for immigrant women, some of these women pursue higher education and careers in professional fields. However, many of these women often do not have the luxury of easy access to the US's educational and professional institutions, and thus comprise about "46 percent of the domestic workforce [in the US] and make up close to the entire population of domestic workers in major cities such as New York." [2] Due to these women's statuses as immigrants working in compromised positions, it is easy for employers to exploit and abuse these women, which presents a lot of issues faced by this community due to the lack of administrative action to protect these women.
      </p>
      <p>Several problems migrant women face involve “reproductive health issues, domestic violence, poor job quality within traditionally female occupations, and  difficulty accessing supportive services.” [3] In my research, I’ve found that “60 percent of undocumented women are in the labor force, mostly working in informal and contingent occupations — as child care or elder care providers or in various service industries.” [4] The other 40% of undocumented women workers work “without pay in the home, providing home maintenance and repair, household administration, and caring for children and other family members” [4] These statistics provide insight as to what kind of work migrant women workers are exposed to and what kinds of environments facilitate common issues that these women face such as domestic violence and exploitation. Immigrant, undocumented women are also “highly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation either by their employers or their family sponsor,” largely due to their statuses as undocumented women with lack of protections and rights under the US government. [4] In addition, a study conducted by Domestic Workers United found that "33 percent of domestic workers in New York City had experienced some form of physical or verbal abuse," [2] which highlights the severity of the issues these women face. In addition, living in a Trump-led administration as a migrant woman means to live under constant attack, as shown by the surge of ICE raids, the Muslim travel ban, the advocacy for a wall at the Mexico-US border, acts of violence and intimidation by hate groups, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>Some ways people are working to better the lives of these migrant women are by advocating for immigrant and undocumented rights and working against the ways the system is set up against these women. Some organizations such as <a href="https://www.icwclaw.org/">ICWC (Immigration Center for Women and Children)</a> focus on outreach efforts to immigrant women and providing free or affordable services to these women regardless of their documentation status. In addition, they focus on issues such as sexual violence and abuse and provide resources in order to better uplift these women. Although there are efforts being made by NPO's and other organizations such as ICWC in order to serve this community of migrant women, there are still threats made towards these women's safety that can only be resolved with deep administrative and social reform (ie: better, less convoluted pathways to citizenship, fight against xenophobic and misogynistic rhetoric, etc). Although these goals seem far off and difficult to achieve, we must push to better uplift these women and give them the basic decency that they deserve for providing services and labor that many of us benefit from.
