      <h1>Project Brief</h1>
      <p>For this project, I wanted to create a platform that would give agency to immigrant women to project their voices and share their stories with the general public. This project recognizes the ways in which immigrant women have often been deprived of their rights to voice their concerns, especially of issues that largely affect immigrant women and the domestic labor sector that many of these women are employed in. Issues such as sexual violence and assault, misogyny, racism, and labor exploitation are just a few issues immigrant women in domestic labor face in addition to the issues brought up by the prevalent pro-deportation and anti-immigrant rhetoric in the U.S.A. “Under the same sky” hopes to bridge connections between these women and the rest of the population in order to bring attention to the struggles these women face and to give a voice to these women who are often neglected and unheard.</p><br>
      <p>There are two target audiences for this project: those who are not educated on issues of immigrant rights but are curious to learn more and other immigrant women who may take solace in the stories being shared and may be interested in sharing a story of their own. These are the two audiences that this project may most appeal to because of the project’s goal of bridging connections and creating empathy between the user and the stories being told. In addition, this platform also wishes to create connections within the community of immigrant women and to affirm the existences and struggles that these women face.</p><br>
      <p>The goals of this project are to amplify the voices of immigrant women and to give them agency over their own stories and narratives and how they are spread, in addition to educating others who may not share the same experiences and opening up their perspectives on immigrants and the movement for immigrant rights. This project hopes to push the general public to be more accepting of the immigrant community and suggests that we all should take part in protecting immigrant women, who are often exploited and are susceptible to deportation. This project strives to push the conversation about immigration towards one of acceptance and empathy for this population of people. These goals are to be met by creating a creative and visually appealing platform that draws the user in and provides an interactive experience for each individual story that the user comes across throughout the site.</p><br>
      <p>Some visual strategies I will be implementing in this project are centering on motifs of sky, freedom, the crossing (and the dissolution) of borders, and migrant rights. Some common symbols for immigrant rights movements for the Chicanx/Latinx communities are hummingbirds and monarch butterflies. To make the symbolism and visual motifs  more appealing and relatable to a more expansive community, I decided to move forward with using bird imagery, using birds from different communities to symbolize the migration of each story (ie: hummingbird for South/Central America, hawk-eagle for Indonesia/Malay regions, swallow/crane for East/Southeast Asia). In addition, I decided to implement visual symbols of the sky in order to portray the boundlessness of the sky and how despite the fact that borders and nations enforce imaginary lines that keep families, cultures, and people apart, we all share the same sky and should not be enforcing such divisions. In terms of type and color, this project was largely inspired by artist Jess X Snow’s animation “Migration is Natural” which primarily uses, dark and light colors (mainly blue, yellow/beige, red, and black). This project uses similar colors (dark blue, light red, beige) in addition to more visually striking colors such as bright teal and white. The typography is mostly sans-serif, with the titles using a handwritten font to emulate the idea of a “written story.” The project will also implement the javascript library animate on scroll to provide users an easy, but interesting interaction that will help fuel the journey and narrative aspect of the site. In addition, I will also use CSS animations to make the sky more lively and to help the user feel as if they are truly in a realm of stars. By implementing these visual strategies, this project will convey a specific yet appealing aesthetic that will draw in users and introduce them to the issues that many immigrant women face.</p>
